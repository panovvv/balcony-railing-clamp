# Balcony railing clamp

![assembly](https://github.com/panovvv/balcony-railing-clamp/raw/master/media/assembly.png?raw=true)

Just something I'd designed to mount all kinds of things on my balcony.
Utilizes laser-cut plywood and threaded rods for generic support structure,
and 3D-printed part(s) to mount specific devices. Right now there's only
one, and it's an action cam style mounting bracket (think GoPro and numerous clones).
